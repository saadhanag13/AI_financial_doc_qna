Introduction\nYouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San\nBruno, California. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed\nKarim. It is owned by Google, and is the second most visited website, after Google Search. YouTube\nis one of the most popular social media platforms all over the world, with the latest data indicating\nthat the website has around 122 million daily active users making it the second largest popular social\nmedia platform behind Facebook. Data shows that the number of videos uploaded every minute has\nbeen growing by 40 percent between 2014 and 2020. Monthly, YouTube records 2.1 billion active\nusers worldwide, with the number projected to continue growing with time. The high number of\nvisitors can be attributed to the ease with which users can access the website, with data showing that\n40.9 percent of YouTube watch time occurs on Mobile devices. Notably, the largest percentage of\nusers, 56 percent, are male, with the age distribution being across the board.\nConsequently, YouTube has emerged as an indispensable tool for marketers keen to achieve the\nefficient utilization of marketing budget on their hands. The platform is largely used for awareness\ngeneration, customer engagement, and sales conversion. Google reckons that 70 percent of YouTube\nviewers who saw marketing advertisements on their platform end up buying a brand after seeing it\non YouTube, indicating the efficiency of the platform in product and service conversion. In 2020,\nApple spent US$237.15 million running advertisements on the platform, which is a testament to the\neffectiveness of the platform as a marketing platform (Tafesse, 2020). As long as marketers ensure\nthat they create a captivating YouTube ad and place it in front of the right audience, they can be\nassured that they will recoup their advertising spend. One way through which marketers can improve\nupon their ability to develop captivating YouTube videos is by analyzing trending YouTube videos\nso that they can develop captivating advertisements. In this paper, data on the most popular YouTube\nVideos released in a decade from 2007 to 2016 is analyzed to usable and distillate information on the\nelements that account for the popularity of YouTube videos. The reason for choosing 10 years of data\nis that YouTube became popular software in the same decade, while streaming media also became\nincreasingly popular in the same decade. Using data from Kaggle Application within 10 years is more\ninformative. The data contains 115 popular videos published on YouTube website between 2007 and\n2016, where the data items include video release date, video type, video duration and other\ninformation. The video types include Video Category Label, Travel & Events, Sports, etc. The video\nduration is stored in seconds, which we need to convert to minutes in the analysis process. The hotness\n84",

The increasing number of popular videos points to\nthe utility of YouTube as a platform for reaching out to the audience in the sense that the number of\npopular videos has been increasing over time between 2006 and 2016. The increase in popularity\npoints to an increasing number of users visiting YouTube and indicates that YouTube content creators\nhave mastered the strategies that can be effectively leveraged to enhance the levels of viewer\nengagement with their videos.\nInteresting information emerges regarding the length of the videos that content publishers should\nupload to the website. More than three-quarters of the most popular video had a length between 0-9\nminutes. Thus, one should be very wary of uploading videos that the viewers may consider too long\nas they may end up failing to attract the interest of the customer. The phenomenon could also be\nattributed to the fragmentation of viewers' attention, which makes it hard for them to focus on long-\nform videos (Tafesse, 2020).\nFor a video to be popular on the YouTube platform, the viewer should provide it in HD quality as\nopposed to SD quality. The technological progress and the level of quality of videos available on the\nYouTube platform have improved over the years, making it necessary for content creators to develop\nhigh-quality videos if they want to attract the attention of the viewers. The preference for HD-quality\nvideo point to the need for content creators to invest in the equipment required to produce high-quality\nvideos.\nNotably, the people and blogs category had the highest number of trending videos accounting for\nmore than a third. The data points to the high interest of viewers in videos that explore the category.\nScience and technology was the next most popular YouTube video category. When creating content,\nit would be advisable for marketing to design the content in such a way that it aligns with the aspects\nemphasized within the two categories. Contrary to expectations, categories such as music, news and\npolitics, sports, and films did not have a high number of trending videos (Golnari & Zhang, 2014).\nThe marketer has to tailor their YouTube content to ensure that it contains content that is likely to\nelicit more interest from the viewer.\nIt was insightful to note that the number of likes in a video was dependent on the number of views\nreported in a video. That is, the more popular a video is, the higher the number of likes that it is likely\nto attract from YouTube views. Thus, a content creator should focus on increasing the extent to which\na video is captivating if they would like to attract more engagement from the intended audience\n(Tafesse, 2020). As long as one creates a video that is captivating for the intended audience, they are\nlikely to receive positive ratings from the viewers. The same trend applies to the number of dislikes\nand comments attracted by a trending video. As long as the viewership of a given video is high, the\nnumber of likes, dislikes, and comments will be high.\nInterestingly, the distribution of viewers' engagement with the video varies by category. Science\nand technology reported the highest level of likes and dislikes, followed by news and politics, and\nentertainment. Of these, popular videos belonging to the News and Politics category reported the\nhighest number of dislikes, with entertainment reporting the lowest number of dislikes (Golnari &\nZhang, 2014). Despite having the largest number of popular videos by category, People & Blogs\ncategory had the fifth highest number of likes and dislikes. It is evident to marketing content creators\nthat the nature of the content is likely to influence the level of viewer engagement with a given video.\nA video that has an aspect of science and technology is likely to attract more engagement from the\naudience.\nOverall, the most popular video on the YouTube platform that was uploaded between 2007 and\n2016 was of HD quality, was shorter than 9 minutes, and belonged mainly to the People & Blog\ncategory and Science & Technology sections. The level of engagement of the viewers with the\ntrending video at the time heavily depended upon the number of views. Of the categories, the science\nand technology popular video had the highest number of engagements, followed by news and politics.\n90",

The preference for HD-quality,\r\n,video point to the need for content creators to invest in the equipment required to produce high-quality\r\nvideos.,\r\n,\"Notably, the people and blogs category had the highest number of trending videos accounting for\"\r\nmore than a third. The data points to the high interest of viewers in videos that explore the category.,\r\n\"Science and technology was the next most popular YouTube video category. When creating content,\",\r\nit would be advisable for marketing to design the content in such a way that it aligns with the aspects,\r\n\"emphasized within the two categories. Contrary to expectations, categories such as music, news and\",\r\n\"politics, sports, and films did not have a high number of trending videos (Golnari & Zhang, 2014).\",\r\nThe marketer has to tailor their YouTube content to ensure that it contains content that is likely to,\r\nelicit more interest from the viewer.,\r\n,It was insightful to note that the number of likes in a video was dependent on the number of views\r\n\"reported in a video. That is, the more popular a video is, the higher the number of likes that it is likely\",\r\n\"to attract from YouTube views. Thus, a content creator should focus on increasing the extent to which\",\r\na  video  is  captivating  if  they  would  like  to  attract  more  engagement  from  the  intended  audience,\r\n\"(Tafesse, 2020). As long as one creates a video that is captivating for the intended audience, they are\",\r\nlikely to receive positive ratings from the viewers. The same trend applies to the number of dislikes,\r\n\"and comments attracted by a trending video. As long as the viewership of a given video is high, the\",\r\n\"number of likes, dislikes, and comments will be high.\",\r\n,\"Interestingly, the distribution of viewers' engagement with the video varies by category. Science\"\r\n\"and technology reported the highest level of likes and dislikes, followed by news and politics, and\",\r\n\"entertainment.  Of  these,  popular  videos  belonging  to  the  News  and  Politics  category  reported  the\",\r\n\"highest number of dislikes, with entertainment reporting the lowest number of dislikes (Golnari &\",\r\n\"Zhang,  2014).  Despite  having  the  largest  number  of  popular  videos  by  category,  People  &  Blogs\",\r\ncategory had the fifth highest number of likes and dislikes. It is evident to marketing content creators,\r\nthat the nature of the content is likely to influence the level of viewer engagement with a given video.,\r\nA video that has an aspect of science and technology is likely to attract more engagement from the,\r\naudience.,\r\n,\"Overall, the most popular video on the YouTube platform that was uploaded between 2007 and\"\r\n\"2016  was  of  HD  quality,  was  shorter  than  9  minutes,  and  belonged  mainly  to  the  People &  Blog\",\r\ncategory  and  Science  &  Technology  sections.  The  level  of  engagement  of  the  viewers  with  the,\r\n\"trending video at the time heavily depended upon the number of views. Of the categories, the science\",\r\n\"and technology popular video had the highest number of engagements, followed by news and politics.\",\r\n"

To this end, the research provides evidence\nadvancing the view that video length and the type of content influence the number of views that a\ngiven video attracts from YouTube users (Tafesse, 2020). In addition, the current research adds to the\nexisting literature, which shows that the level of viewer engagement with a given video heavily\ndepends upon the number of views reported.\nThe research also has significant insights that can be used to inform the creation of YouTube\nvideos. Technically, one should produce a short, high-quality video that quickly communicates to the\nintended audience (Ten-Hove & Van der Meij, 2015). Content creators should be aware that few\nYouTube viewers are willing to invest a significant amount of their time watching a single video.\nRegarding content, it is essential to create content that falls within the Science & Technology category\nor People & Blog category, as most popular YouTube videos belong to the two categories (Barjasteh,\nLiu, & Radha, 2014). From the high number of dislikes reported, a market should avoid the News\nand Politics category, given its tendency to generate negative reactions from the viewers.\n5.2 Limitations and Future Direction\nWhile the current study yields insightful information, one needs to take into account several\nlimitations that are likely to affect the interpretation of the study findings. Notably, the current study\nwas conducted using a dataset collected between 2007 and 2016. Consequently, the variables that\ndetermine the popularity of a given video may not necessarily be applicable in 2022, given the fast\npace with which technology changes. In addition, the focus of the analysis was trending videos. Given\nthe changing nature of viewers' tastes, it is essential to consider the likelihood that it may not be\napplicable.

Conclusion\nIn an analysis of trending videos uploaded to the YouTube platform between 2007 and 2016, many\ndefining characteristics of the most popular videos emerged. First, viewers prefer short videos that do\nnot exceed 9 minutes. Second, HD-quality videos are more popular than SD-quality videos.
